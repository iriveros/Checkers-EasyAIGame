# Checkers with EasyAI

This is an implementation of a simplified checkers game using EasyAI in python. This script currently implements AI vs AI only.
### Differences with real checkers
1. Only 1 jump is allowed per turn.
2. You do not take the opponents pieces after jumping over a piece.
3. Victory is achieved when one player's piece enters the territory of the opponent.
